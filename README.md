# Heart_Disease_prediction
The notebook appears to focus on a machine learning project related to cardiovascular disease prediction. Hereâ€™s a summary of its content:

1. **Introduction**:
   - The project begins with importing necessary libraries, such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, along with the cardiovascular dataset. The goal is to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Data exploration includes checking the dataset for missing values and basic descriptive statistics.
   - Features are selected for modeling based on domain relevance, and the data is split into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Training**:
   - The project employs a logistic regression model, with accuracy as the key performance metric.
   - The accuracy of the model was targeted at 95%, and model performance was evaluated accordingly.

4. **Results and Feature Importance**:
   - A bar plot was created to show feature importance, highlighting which factors contributed most to the prediction.
   
5. **Conclusion**:
   - The project successfully achieved its accuracy goal of 95%.
   - Suggestions for further improvement include gathering more data, improving data quality, and trying other machine learning models to improve performance.

This notebook offers a straightforward machine learning approach to cardiovascular disease prediction with logistic regression, focusing on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
